# Causal Inference Reading Club

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This book club is a little different: rather than reading a single book, we'll
be reading through a guided selection of articles and chapters introducing
various topics in causal inference.

Each week is organized as usual, with a folder with information about what we're
reading. Additionally, there is a shared Zotero library with the readings for
every week to help simplify the process. Contact Malcolm if you don't have
access to it.
