### SQL resources

- [Chapter 6 queries](https://sqlfordatascientists.com/chapter-6/) (Note: this is the last chapter included on the book website, so we won't have a copy of the chapter queries to link to going forward.)
- [Mode SQL tutorial: SQL Window functions](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions). BoltSQL doesn't have a tutorial on window functions, so if you want more practice, check out the Mode tutorials. See the [intro for running SQL in Mode's in-browser IDE](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-in-mode).
- [Mode SQL tutorial: Subqueries](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-sub-queries)
- [BoltSQL Article: Subqueries](https://sqlbolt.com/topic/subqueries): Note that this is a short article and not an interactive tutorial.

See also DuckDB's documentation on the [`QUALIFY` clause](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/query_syntax/qualify.html) that allows you to filter on windowed results and the [`WINDOW` clause](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/query_syntax/window.html) that allows you to name and reuse window specifications.
