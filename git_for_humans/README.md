From the website description:

> Git’s model of version control makes it indispensable for collaborating on digital projects of all stripes. Get situated with Git as David Demaree guides you through the command-line workflow, the nuances of repositories and branches, the elements of a solid commit message, and more. Pick up common version-tracking tasks, along with advice on trickier scenarios. You’ll learn how to put Git to work for you—and work better with your team.

*Git for Humans* (sorry lab pets) is a short book (only five chapters) that focuses on the basics of git. Each week, we'll also have bonus material for practice exercises, as well as links to doing what we learned in the book using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).

Each week is organized as a folder here, which each folder containing information about the week's content. Start by opening `week_1` and checking out the `README`.

In addition to the book, we'll rely on a few sources:

* [GitKraken Git tutorials](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials), which have both instructions for the command line and videos for doing the same thing in GitKraken
* [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/git-and-github-learning-resources)
* [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/): An interactive course on basic git concepts, as well as more advanced topics
